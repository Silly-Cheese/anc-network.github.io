      <li># Updates!

Hello @everyone,

I am pleased to announce that we have officially set up the Roblox Group! In addition, I have completed, or semi-completed, a website for us! 

This is a large step, and some of these are still new. So, if there are any bugs, let us know! 

**ROBLOX GROUP:** https://www.roblox.com/communities/35861240/A-N-C-Network#!/about
**WEBSITE:** https://silly-cheese.github.io/anc.github.io/index.html  (I understand, the website URL looks suspicious, but it looks like this because I am hosting it through GitHub, and too dumb to figure out how to make it work well.)

For the guest password, use: Guest123
If you are an owner or affiliate, tag me (<@1036433371393441914>) asking for the password if I have not already told you.</li>
